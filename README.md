## Selene-in-SUITS
Welcome to the Selene in SUITS 2024-2025 repository! Our most recent upload is for February 13th, and it includes basic layout for our autonomous structure and UI layouts. Below are the instructions to run our project as is.

## GUI Instructions
To start the test server:
1. navigate to `Selene-2025/User_Interface/UI_Main/client`

2. run with `npm start`
    
3. If you face any issues with `npm start`, run `npm install` and `npm install react-scripts` which should resolve any issues

## Autonomous Instructions
Currently we only have a structural UML diagram for how we plan to implement autonomous features which we will work to implement over the coming months.
